Amulet is a Lua-based audio/visual toolkit designed for small games and experimentation.

Here's what a minimal Hello World! looks like in Amulet:

```lua
am.window{}.scene = am.text("Hello World!")
```

## Supported platforms

It currently runs on the following platforms:

- Windows 7+
- Mac OS X
- Linux
- iOS
- Android
- HTML5

## Binary distributions

These are available from <http://www.amulet.xyz>.

## Documentation

## Reporting bugs or requesting features

I don't use the github issue tracker. Instead please email bug reports

## Building from source

### Linux

Make sure you have gcc and g++ installed, then do:

```
make
```

If you get errors, you may also need to install additional dev packages,
such as as libgl1-mesa-dev (for OpenGL headers) or libasound2-dev
(for audio support in SDL).

### OSX

Install the command line developer tools (clang, clang++), then do:

```
make
```

### Windows

You will need to install [MinGW and MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/)
as well as a Microsoft Visual C compiler.

You will need to create your own version of msys.bat with something
like the following at the top:

```
call "%VS120COMNTOOLS%vsvars32.bat" >NUL:
```

(VS120COMNTOOLS may be different depending on which version
of Visual Studio you're using.)

This sets up the Visual Studio command line environment.

Then, from the msys shell, do:

```
make
```

### Cross compiling

It's also possible to cross-compile to various platforms (e.g. HTML5, iOS, MinGW).
See the files .travis.yml, scripts/appveyor.bat and scripts/travis.sh for
examples of how to do this.
